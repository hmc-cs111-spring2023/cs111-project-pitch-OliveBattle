# Contract

## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

	What I most want to get out of this project is a better understanding of how to effectively design a project? Since this is a class on Domain Specific Languages, I'm obviously going to be doing so through the lens of designing a custom programming language to fit a specific domain. One of the big issues I have with working on projects outside this course is wanting to get right into solving the technical issues that the project presents, which can often lead to unintuitive and sometimes counterproductive design choices being made in the middle of the project. In this project, I kind of want the experience of going in with a specific plan for what to do, and then making deliberate changes across the project as hurdles are found.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

	First and foremost, I want to work on the skills used for external DSLs more than I want to work on the skills needed for an internal DSL. This is because external DSLs would work on skills that are more unique to programming language development- technically you have to come up with a way to parse text, and design-wise you're free to design a syntax from the ground up, rather than just working around the the host language's specific syntax. 

	Besides that, I'd also like to touch on the idea of 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

	I'd like to work on the project at a consistent rate, putting in a specific number of hours a week towards designing the project. I also want to work on it in specific blocks of time dedicated ot the project, rather than just working on it haphazardly.
	The project can be divided into a few key phases. The first one would be frontend design - coming up with the syntax and the final product, and figuring out what libraries I might need to work with for stuff like editing images or sound files. Next would be coming up with, and then implementing, a structure for the backend - A set of functions that would be able to build up to the wanted output. After that would be a parser that can convert from the external DSL to these functions, and the final phase would be polishing what was already done to make the language more usable based on other's feedback. 

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

	N/A

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

	One thing that I can make sure to do is to give feedback on not just the errors and implementation details, but also the general design of the program and ways that their project could better meet the goals they set out to achieve. If I already have some level of experience in the domain, then critiquing on the feel of the program as implemented could easily provide insight. But for most of the projects people are working on, I won't have experience in the domain- in these cases, I can give insight by seeing how their current implementation of the project, and all the tradeoffs they've made, lines up with their sample "ideal" syntax. (Or, more generally, how the UX they have relates to the UX they set out to achieve in this pitch.)

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

	I would be proud to show somebody a project that works while maintaining a relatively 'clean' syntax. Designing a new programming language that's perfect as a one-person team is a daunting task. Because of this, it'll be understandable if the final syntax is significantly different from the one I set out to work on. As long as the project is pretty clean (as in, works from a few well-designed parts, rather than a ton of hacky rules), I'll be happy with it.

	I'd also like my project to implement some novel functionality that isn't covered by any alternative DSL that already exists. adding some new function would give the program a reason to be used over those (much more refined) progrmming languages, which adds some ability for it to 'actually be used.' 

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

	an A- would be a project that follows the design goals I set out earlier in this contact- having a few specific, streamlined items, rather than lots of confusing-to-follow code everywhere, and would also require that the final syntax be simple and also nvel compared to existing programing languages.

	A project that meets all the definitions of an A-, and is functional enough to serve as a full on DSL (with error handling and commenting and all that) would be an A.
